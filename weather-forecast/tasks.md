1. Document package weather

Since goblins are not as smart as you are, they forgot what the package should do for them. Please write a comment for <code>package weather</code> that describes its contents. The package comment should introduce the package and provide information relevant to the package as a whole.

2. Document the <code>CurrentCondition</code> and <code>CurrentLocation</code> variables

The president of Goblinocus is a bit paranoid and fears uncommented variables are used to destroy their country. Please clarify the usage of the package variables <code>CurrentCondition</code> and <code>CurrentLocation</code> and put the president's mind at ease. This should tell any user of the package what information the variables store, and what they can do with it.


3. Document the <code>Forecast()</code> function

Goblinocus forecast operators want to know what the <code>Forecast()</code> function does (but do not tell them how it works, since unfortunately, they will get more confused). Please write a comment for this function that describes what the function does, but not how it does it.
